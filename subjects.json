Aboriginal Land, Law and Philosophy will enable the development of a deep and nuanced engagement with a selection of major issues. These may include land tenure, crime and punishment, political representation, social policy, cultural production, governance and economics. Using land and country as a base, these issues will be explored from Indigenous and non-Indigenous perspectives and from the interdsciplinary perspective of Literary Studies, Philosophy and Law. The interdisciplinary fusion of Literary Studies with Philosophy and Law will create a divergent interrogation of how land, possession and dispossession has influenced materially, legally and theoretically the experience of Indigenous Australians.", "On successful completion of this subject, students should have:", "At the completion of this subject, students should gain the following generic skills:"],

Our focus is on key structures and relationships used in commercial transactions, and the question of how such structures and relationships may affect third parties. As commercial parties often need to decide what legal structure to adopt in a relationship, we consider and compare the differing legal consequences of different types of commercial transactions, looking at their effect on both contracting parties and third parties. In doing so, we look at how key conceptual building blocks of commercial law (such as agency; trusts; sale; assignment; and security) are applied in practice. Given the international nature of much commercial law, and the important ongoing influence of shared common law concepts, we consider both Australian and English materials.", "The syllabus remains flexible to ensure that our focus is on recent developments and topics of current interest. In 2019, the core topics studied will be: (i) agency: its internal and external aspects; (ii) trusts and their use in commercial transactions; (iii) sale and the effect of passing property; (iv) assignment of contractual rights and the practical effects of non-assignment clauses; (v) the operation of good faith in commercial relationships.  Broader themes to be discussed include: (i) the effects of different transactions on third parties, including the limits placed by the law on the parties\u2019 freedom to determine such effects; (ii) the interaction of common law, equity and statute in commercial contexts.", "Students taking this subject will be assumed to have a basic knowledge of the principles of contract law, property law, equity and trusts, as applied in Australia or other legal jurisdictions.", "Principal topics:", " ", "A student who has successfully completed this subject will:"],

        "overview": ["This subject studies a select number of advanced topics in the field of constitutional law. It builds on the concepts and ideas introduced in Principles of Public Law and Constitutional Law. The focus of study will be the Australian constitutional system, but the subject will draw on insights from other jurisdictions. The subject thus also provides an introduction to the field of comparative constitutional law, which seeks to understand and evaluate the purposes and functions of constitutions using comparative analysis.", "The aim of the subject is to interrogate a number of fundamental questions that arise in the field of constitutional law. Should a constitution have a bill of rights and, if so, which type? How should courts decide cases? What checks and balances should be imposed on the exercise of public power? Are constitutions effective at protecting human rights and democratic government? How easy should it be for future generations to amend a constitution? The subject will study these questions by drawing on relevant scholarly writings and judicial decisions. ", "The first part of the subject will investigate one of the bedrock principles of the Australian Constitution: judicial review. It will consider whether it is legitimate for courts to review primary legislation for compatibility with the Constitution. In doing so, it will investigate why this issue has a different degree of salience in the United States. This comparison will provide an opportunity to consider the potential benefits and methodological difficulties associated with the study of comparative constitutional law.", "The second part of the subject will examine a range of structural features of the Australian Constitution. In particular, it will analyse the justifications for, and specific aspects of, federalism and the separation of powers. This analysis will be supplemented by consideration of these features in other countries such as Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States.", "The third part of the subject will examine a range of rights-related features of the Australian Constitution. In particular, it will consider some of the provisions not considered in detail in Principles of Public Law and Constitutional Law, such as trial by jury (s 80) and freedom of religion (s 116), and what challenges might arise if a bill of rights was to be included in the Constitution. This part will look at the lessons that can be taken from the experience of countries such as Canada, India, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom.", "A student who has successfully completed this subject will:"],

The subject begins with a review of the most frequent errors in the writing of students who speak English as a Second Language, including errors in morphology, syntax, cohesion, and punctuation, and then considers the impact that such errors may have on meaning. In the second half of the subject, students engage in linguistic analysis of a range of work-place texts (e.g. short reports, media releases). The aim of this analysis is to identify the most salient grammatical and stylistic features that contribute to the clarity of the texts. Throughout the subject students will engage in identifying areas of concern in their writing (annotation), self and peer editing exercises, keeping logs of their progress, and using available online grammar resources.", "Upon successful completion of this subject students should have:", "At the completion of this subject, students should:"],

Students will engage with a diverse range of physiological questions and the experimental strategies used to address them. Students will learn to critique seminars and to focus on the scientific essentials, i.e. what question is being addressed? What led up to this question? What strategies are being used to answer the question, and how well have they succeeded? Three seminars will receive particular attention. Questions and recommended reading, set by the speaker, will be distributed several days in advance, to assist the student to start thinking along helpful lines before each of these three seminars. After attending each of these seminars, students will participate in workshops in which directed questions and structured discussion will be used to engage students further with the scientific issues arising from the seminars.", "To develop student awareness and knowledge of how contemporary physiological questions are addressed in a broad range of sub-disciplines; To cultivate an appreciation and understanding of the major sub-disciplines of physiological research; To increase students\u2019 knowledge of the experimental approaches and strategies used in different areas of physiology, and to think of ways that these could be applied to their own research projects; To teach students to think critically about the limitations and weaknesses that are associated with virtually all experimental strategies; To encourage students to conceptualize their own experimental strategies and approaches to physiological questions.", "Analysing complex scientific issues.

Each of the six determinants of health (genetics, environment, nutrition, welfare, infectious disease and exposure to toxic agents) is explored with reference to authentic case studies. Appreciation of the multifactorial nature of health determination is then developed as students apply their understanding to cases that require integration of multiple principles in the analysis of animal health issues. Through industry-based placements as well as case-based syndicate work, students apply their understanding of animal health principles to the examination and analysis of animal production industries of importance both within Australia and internationally.", "Please refer to VETS90060"],

It covers approaches drawn from both humanities and social sciences, including approaches to the analysis of media texts, investigating media audiences, media engagement and media use. Students completing this subject will gain a deeper understanding of a range of different theoretical perspectives on media, and the way in which these are connected to different heuristic and methodological approaches to investigation and research. To this end, the subject draws on a variety of case studies and applications which students will be invited to critically consider. On completing this subject, students will have developed an understanding of different perspectives on and approaches to investigating media, as a basis upon which they can go on to design and undertake their own research projects.", "On successful completion of this subject, students should have:", "At the completion of this subject, students should gain the following generic skills:"],

Teams of 2-3 students from engineering disciplines will team up with business students and with people from medical and law backgrounds to conceive and design an innovative medical device, taking it through all steps of development. The students in the teams will complete assessment items together, each member primarily contributing according to their specialisation. The teams will create an engineering prototype of their invention, draft a provisional patent application, and compose a detailed business plan.

These techniques are presented within an historical context, beginning with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), continuing with electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and finishing with modern molecular genetic techniques. The second approach emphasises a bottom-up approach including the topics of brain genetics and development, neurons and neural circuits, neurotransmission and neurotransmitter substances, and the structurofunctional properties of selected brain regions. Neurobiological principles are illustrated using conditions with abnormal neuronal function. The third approach combines the top-down and bottom-up approaches to demonstrate how combining knowledge of cognitive theory and structurofunctional properties of the brain enables diagnosis and interpretation of pathological conditions.

In particular, students will be exposed to prominent techniques in the field for example: X-ray Crystallography, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and cryogenic-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM). As part of a general introduction into measurement techniques students will visit state-of-the-art NMR, cryo-EM and X-ray facilities at the Bio21 Institute and the Australian Synchrotron. Using industry standard software packages, students will learn to input and handle data to reconstruct biomolecular structure and dynamics across the range of techniques. The computer based laboratories will be overseen by practitioners in the field. This multi-disciplinary subject is co-taught by staff in the School of Physics, Chemistry and Biomedical sciences. There is particular emphasis on integration of these disciplines with students receiving both theoretical and practical knowledge of fundamental and frontier research and development in biomolecular structure determination.", "On completion of this subject the student should be able\u00a0to:"],

This subject explores Bollywood film and dance through a blended learning model, with contact hours comprising viewing of films and online lectures with embodied learning through practical rehearsal and performance of Bollywood style dance pieces. Lectures will analyse the \u2018rasas\u2019 (or rules) that guide the storytelling in film, and their basis on nine key emotional states. Students will combine this critical understanding with their experience of learning Bollywood dance to undertake a practical creative task. Film screenings will be provided in a cinema and students are strongly advised to attend these to experience them as a community, as is traditional, though they may choose to view them in their own time. The subject objectives are two-fold: to learn about the world\u2019s largest film industry, \u2018Bollywood\u2019, through an in-depth study of some of its outstanding examples and to explore and understand the efficacy and inter-relatedness of different ways of learning (critical/analytical, creative practice, embodied knowledge and critical self-reflection).", "Upon completion of this subject students should:"],

        "overview": ["Cartel conduct is regarded as anathema to competitive markets and consumer welfare. Such conduct encompasses various forms of collusion or collaboration between competitors, the most serious of which involve fixing prices, diving markets, restricting output and rigging bids. These categories of collusion have been shown to raise prices, reduce quality and choice, and stifle business responsiveness and innovation. They are also hard to detect, prosecute and deter. Tougher anti-cartel laws and sanctions have been a high priority for competition authorities for at least the last decade. While there is a high degree of consensus around the world as to the core tenets of the prohibitions applicable to serious cartel conduct, there is a vigorous discourse amongst authorities, practitioners, business and academics regarding the most effective approaches to sanctioning and enforcement.", "At the same time, not all agreements between business rivals are anti-competitive or detrimental to consumer welfare. Some, such as joint ventures or distribution agreements, may be driven by efficiencies or may be welfare-enhancing in other ways. Competition laws and their enforcement therefore need to distinguish between different types of conduct involving competitors based on their economic rationale and likely effects.", "This subject refreshes and expands understanding of the economic principles relevant to collusion (or horizontal restraints) that were introduced in the first subject in the course (Foundations: Competition Law & Economics).

Censorship practices and protocols will be defined and investigated in relation to issues of morality, legality and the public sphere. The changing definitions and complexities of censorship will be investigated in instances of creative freedom challenging prohibition in film, performing arts, visual art and media cultures. Students will gain a theoretical understanding of the historical and emerging debates surrounding the controversial area of censorship, freedom of speech and expression. Students will also study censorship in national and international contexts with an emphasis on specific case studies. This subject will also examine how artistic practice influences wider cultural, political and legal prohibitions underlying film, the arts and media.", "On successful completion of this subject, students should be able to:", "At the completion of this subject, students should gain the following generic skills:"],

This comprises the following tasks: design of a process to meet a specified requirement; feasibility study of alternative processes which meet the specification; determination of sequence for investigation of a chemical manufacturing project and preparation of a report; consideration of environmental impacts and sustainability issues; preparation of flowsheets; confirmation of effects of market forecasts; economic evaluation; preparation of estimates for the minimisation of capital and production costs; specification of equipment; selection of construction materials; and specification of instrumentation location, staff and labour requirements and safety precautions. The HYSYS simulation package will be utilised where appropriate. There will also be a series of lectures on various aspects of design.", "This subject forms the major capstone design project for the Chemical engineering Discipline and closely simulates the design procedures the graduate students will undertake in chemical industry as process and design engineers. The pre-requisites ensure that the students bring together all of the undergraduate knowledge and skills imparted in earlier years of the degree program. All aspects of the safe and environmentally responsible design of a chemical process plant are covered in this unit through project based learning. Through a careful sequential approach, the students develop a feasibility study, an initial process scoping and development report, and finally, a detailed design report. Team work is emphasized throughput to mimic the typical team environment the students will encounter in the work place.", " ", "INDICATIVE CONTENT", "No new topics of a technical are introduced into this unit.

Trends of globalization, de-industrialization, increasing (youth) unemployment, changing gender roles and demographic ageing have transformed substantially the nature of employment relationships and work in advanced economies. Labour force has become more diverse in the composition of workers \u2013 with more women, older workers and immigrants \u2013 while more divided by people\u2019s education, race and gender. In this subject we will investigate how changes in the labour market institutions, as well as changes in the organization and composition of workers have produced disparities in careers, wages and labour market dynamics within and across generations over the past decades. To address these issues, the subject combines insights from sociological and economic labour market theory, ranging from classic human capital and job search models to more sociological approaches that emphasize the structure of organizations and institutions within a comparative perspective. We will use this theoretical background to discuss more recent empirical work about e.g., changing work and employment relationships; transformation of job histories and careers; the rising wage and gender inequality; the role of welfare states and institutions; discrimination in the labour market; and the intergenerational transmission of (dis)advantage. Through active in-class discussions, quizzes and exercises students will learn how to interpret labour market theories and critically assess empirical work.", "Students who successfully complete this subject should:"],

Students are required to complete 50 days placement in the Psychology Department at the Royal Children\u2019s Hospital and the University of Melbourne Psychology Clinic at Blackwood Street, North Melbourne, of which 40 days (including 3 days of clinical training workshops) will be at the Royal Children\u2019s Hospital and 10 days will be within the University of Melbourne Psychology Clinic seeing adult clients. The placement will combine patient contact, supervision and the optional delivery of training. Over the 50 days, students are required to accrue 120 hours of face-to-face contact with patients (assessment and treatment of children and adults: 100 hours within the Royal Children\u2019s Hospital and 20 hours at the University of Melbourne Psychology Clinic. Assessment will comprise about 50-60 % of case hours with individual treatment comprising the remainder. There may also be scope for family or group treatment.Individual supervision may be augmented with group supervision.Supervisors for the field placement component will be registered as both psychologists and supervisors with the Psychologists Registration Board of Victoria.In most cases they will also be a member (or eligible for membership) of the College of Clinical Psychologists of the Australian Psychological Society. The field supervisors will be responsible for ensuring that students are adequately introduced to the field setting and for day-to-day supervision of the student\u2019s placement. Field Supervisors will ensure that students are exposed to a range of clinical work, as far as possible allowing the student to function as a clinical psychologist within the facility.(2)Clinical Case Conference (Co-ordinators: Dr Lisa Phillips/ Dr Rowena Conroy). There are two major purposes for the clinical case conference. The first is to provide the opportunity (structure, feedback) for students to gain skills in presenting case material in an effective, professional manner, with emphases on the following:\u00b7Selection of material (clinical content and focus of presentation)\u2022Organisation of the material (format; use of overheads, etc)\u2022Personal presentation skills\u2022Physical environment\u2022Timing of presentations\u2022Evaluation/feedbackThe second purpose for Clinical Case Conference is to provide the opportunity for students to discuss selected clinical issues in a large group format, with emphases on the following:\u2022Focus/purpose for formal case presentations\u00b7Integration of clinical and research material within scientist-practitioner framework of professional practice.\u2022Discussion of broad professional and ethical issues\u2022Implementation of professional skillsChild specialisation students will alternate between a Clinical Case Conference taken with Clinical and Neuropsychology Students and a specialised Child Clinical Case Conference ", "The subject aims to provide the students withopportunities to experience a range of clinical presentations across the life span and to begin functioning as a clinical psychologist, under the supervision of a field supervisor. Students will receive experience in history taking, conducting assessments, arriving at a case formulation and making treatment plans. Under supervision, students will be given the opportunity to develop competency in the provision of psychological treatments to individual children, families, adults and (where appropriate) groups. In addition, the subject aims to give the student experience of professional psychology practice, including professional presentation, report writing and record keeping, managing a clinical caseload, and liaison with other professional practitioners.", "This placement subject is designed to promote an in-dept understanding of specialist practice, to expand the range of ways in which learning occurs; to develop a capacity to work collaboratively, to confront and manage unfamiliar problems, to value different cultures, and to develop a high regard for human rights, ethics and equity."],

It is designed to offer an overview of and background to, contemporary Mainland Chinese politics and society. It is more historically oriented than many of the other survey courses offered in the Politics program. This emphasis on history is deliberate. We shall begin with the development of the Communist Party and its escape from the Shanghai massacre through to its period of governance in rural China, examining the background to the Long March in the process. This will be followed by a look at the Yan'an period in communist history - a time of ideological reformation and Mao Zedong's rise to power. The experience gained by the Party during this period served as a dream-model of how the country would be run in the future socialist state. This will bring us to the founding of the People's Republic of China in October 1949, and the adoption of the Soviet model of economic planning and governance. The study of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution will focus on the intense, revolutionary and binary politics behind these two campaigns. Then we will look at the reasons Mao initiated these campaigns and why they failed. The transition China has undergone since the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 will form an important part of this course. From a state dominated by a revolutionary politics of commitment China has become a society that is almost entirely market driven. This transition from politics to economics is almost a parable of our post 9/11 times. Chinese politics gives us an opportunity to reflect upon the two types of politics that dominate our world. Chinese politics also gives us a chance to see how one state moved from a social dynamic that was intense, revolutionary and binary in form to one in which money and the commodity dominates. It also allows us to see how a politics of commitment can give way to the appearance of apolitical policy.", "On completion of this subject students should:", " "],

We examine in detail such topics as changes in agriculture and rural living standards, the role of foreign direct investment and the multinational enterprise, the reform of state owned enterprises and corporate governance, and the emergence of a vibrant private sector and an increasingly large consumer market.

This opens new and exciting opportunities for social mobility and economic productivity. Citizens and visitors alike in urban areas now have greater access to education, health, employment and transport.

It is projected that by 2030 two billion persons will live in slums.", "There is a widening participation of actors and agencies - governments, the private sector, civil society and poor communities themselves becoming crucial players in improving and upgrading existing settlements.

Choreography will extend students\u2019 abilities to creatively use choreographic techniques and processes in sophisticated and inventive ways. Central foci will be the inclusion and use of music, the development of complex group structures in time and space and the consideration of the performance space. Building on the theoretical and practical frameworks established in Choreographic Process into Performance 3 choreography for groups continues as an important outcome. Methods of doing this as a sole choreographer are investigated and developed including leadership and directing skills. Students will reflect on their own skills development and critically analyse their own and others\u2019 creative and choreographic work verbally and in writing.", " ", "In Performance students will participate in the third of the five performance projects central to the Bachelor of Fine Arts (Dance) course. Students will participate in making an original work by a guest choreographer or learn and remount an extant dance from a choreographer\u2019s repertory. Students will consolidate their skills as participatory and collaborative dance artists and performers in the creative development processes and/ or the learning and rehearsal stages of a dance work. Interpretive, expressive and articulate physical skills will further develop as students continue to investigate what embodied performance means. Task-based activities to derive new movement material, improvisations, research and a range of ways of exploring creative ideas may be expected in a guest choreographer\u2019s process. This area of the subject will culminate in a Performance season that also includes dances performed by Choreographic Process into Performance 2 students.", "This subject will enable students to:-", "On completion of this subject students should have acquired the following skills:-", "\u00a0"],

While some argue that this associational revolution promises more particpatory, expedient, and decentralized forms of transnational governance, others contend that it reflects little more than the ongoing privatization of the public sphere at the hands of transnational capital. In this course, we evaluate these and alternative perspectives by exploring transformations in the structure of the global political-economy over the past thirty years; looking closely at the roles played by a variety of NGOs and CBOs as part of more multi-layered regimes of 'global governance'; analyzing the shifts in state structures that have made these regimes possible; and teasing apart the ongoing tensions between various factions of what some have called, an emerging 'global civil society'.

The movement of water and sediment along coasts due to wave action and currents is the focus of the coastal hydraulics module. An understanding of wave processes in coastal and surf zones is an essential starting point for the design of coastal structures such as piers, groins and jetties. With impending sea level rise, this will be a significant area of civil engineering practice for the foreseeable future.

Typically affecting only a small portion of each nation's territory, these conflicts have nevertheless impacted these countries' security more broadly. Jihadi terrorism has also added an extra-regional dimension to these conflicts, through their intersection with conflicts outside Southeast Asia, notably at present including the Syrian conflict and groups such as Islamic State in Iraq and Syam (ISIS). With a focus on Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and Myanmar, this course will introduce students to the core theoretical approaches employed in the study of violent conflict and terrorism, to enable case study and comparative analysis. The course will also cover responses to contemporary violence and terrorism attempted by governments, international agencies, communities and civil society organisations.

It builds on knowledge from CVEN90049 Structural Theory and Design 2, in particular the section on the fundamental behaviour of reinforced concrete structural elements when subjected to flexure, axial load and shear. Students will be introduced to strut-and-tie modelling which is used in the analysis and design of complex regions in concrete elements where simple flexural behaviour is disrupted, and also to deformation modelling for reinforced concrete elements which highlights the importance of ductility in these elements. This subject will also introduce advanced concrete technology with discussion of high strength concrete, deterioration mechanisms and the design for durable concrete structures. Students who complete this specialist subject are likely to find employment in design consultancy or concrete construction companies and work under the supervision of a senior engineer.", "INDICATIVE CONTENT", "Partially prestressed concrete beams: Properties of prestressing steel and types of prestressing systems; Sectional behaviour at service load level, equivalent load concept and load balancing; Creep and shrinkage in concrete; Estimation of prestress losses, deflection and amount of cracking; Indeterminate structures; Anchorages; Applications to building and bridge construction; Applications to precast concrete structures; Deformation modelling; Strut-and-tie modelling; High strength concrete; Design against physical and chemical attack of concrete structures.", "INTENDED LEARNING OUTCOMES (ILO)On completion of this subject the student is expected to: 1.
