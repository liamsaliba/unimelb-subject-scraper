The focus of study will be the Australian constitutional system, but the subject will draw on insights from other jurisdictions. The subject thus also provides an introduction to the field of comparative constitutional law, which seeks to understand and evaluate the purposes and functions of constitutions using comparative analysis.", "The aim of the subject is to interrogate a number of fundamental questions that arise in the field of constitutional law. Should a constitution have a bill of rights and, if so, which type? How should courts decide cases? What checks and balances should be imposed on the exercise of public power? Are constitutions effective at protecting human rights and democratic government? How easy should it be for future generations to amend a constitution? The subject will study these questions by drawing on relevant scholarly writings and judicial decisions. ", "The first part of the subject will investigate one of the bedrock principles of the Australian Constitution: judicial review. It will consider whether it is legitimate for courts to review primary legislation for compatibility with the Constitution. In doing so, it will investigate why this issue has a different degree of salience in the United States. This comparison will provide an opportunity to consider the potential benefits and methodological difficulties associated with the study of comparative constitutional law.", "The second part of the subject will examine a range of structural features of the Australian Constitution. In particular, it will analyse the justifications for, and specific aspects of, federalism and the separation of powers. This analysis will be supplemented by consideration of these features in other countries such as Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States.", "The third part of the subject will examine a range of rights-related features of the Australian Constitution. In particular, it will consider some of the provisions not considered in detail in Principles of Public Law and Constitutional Law, such as trial by jury (s 80) and freedom of religion (s 116), and what challenges might arise if a bill of rights was to be included in the Constitution. This part will look at the lessons that can be taken from the experience of countries such as Canada, India, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom."],

Students will learn to critique seminars and to focus on the scientific essentials, i.e. what question is being addressed? What led up to this question? What strategies are being used to answer the question, and how well have they succeeded? Three seminars will receive particular attention. Questions and recommended reading, set by the speaker, will be distributed several days in advance, to assist the student to start thinking along helpful lines before each of these three seminars.

The program is designed to offer opportunities for government professionals to extend their understanding of how economic design principles and mechanisms can improve a range of procurement and other resource allocation decisions. Economic design provides a valuable skillset for public policy professionals as they diagnose and explore a range of policy problems, as well as potential solutions. Economic design provides a framework to understand the strategic interactions between parties in a given environment. The course will introduce students to the design and maintenance of markets and other economic institutions: drawing upon game theory and its important applications in matching markets, auctions, and incentive design. A group of staff will be teaching the course. Each topic will be taught by the expert who has extensive experience in in both theory and practice.", "This subject will comprise two modules: Module 1 'Contracts and Matching Mechanisms'; and Module 2 a capstone experience exploring antitrust and collusion behaviours."],

Effective trial advocacy requires a broad, complex and diverse set of skills, ranging from the ability to develop and present a persuasive narrative (both in an address and by examining a witness) to the ability to force an opposing witness to make concessions that will advance the party's case. ", "Advocacy enables students to develop this set of skills in a supportive workshop environment. Topics covered will include the adversary process; the role of the trial advocate; the development of case theories, themes and labels; opening and closing addresses; and witness examination including examination-in-chief and cross-examination.

Alexander Technique was developed to promote freedom and ease in movement and can provide relief of pain, playing an important role in injury rehabilitation and prevention as new, more effective patterns of movement are learned and integrated into daily life and arts practice. Fundamental to alignment and balance, Alexander Technique has long been recognised for its benefits to actors, singers, musicians and dancers, preventing injury and developing physical, emotional and vocal freedom. Students will participate in various individual and group activities providing a practical context to learn the basic concepts and applied procedures involved in the Alexander Technique. The fundamental skills and understanding developed through this subject will be able to be applied by the student in daily life and in their artistic practice as performers. This unit introduces the skills and knowledge required to improve postural support, balance, movement and breathing in daily life and function. This will develop awareness of habitual patterns of tension and provide foundation embodied knowledge that can be further developed in the Level 2 subject, Alexander Technique for Performance. The practical work will be supported by reading materials that expound the theory, its history and procedures."],

These vastly different, but interconnected societies, have stirred our imaginations for millennia, inspiring those who have shaped history, including Alexander the Great and Napoleon. They will be compared in terms of their monuments, art, mythology, epic narratives, languages, history, and social institutions. Their highly visible legacy, uncovered by generations of archaeologists and historians, will also be examined to define further the processes that developed these complex societies."],

Particular attention will be paid to the past 150,000 years and the impact human societies have had upon ecology. The major areas covered include: the transition from hunter-gathering to settled agricultural societies; the way diseases and society have interacted (including the major plagues in human history); the impact of industrialisation and globalisation upon the biosphere; the emergence of an ecological way of thinking; the political responses to the environmental crisis; and, thinking about how to achieve a sustainable future.", "We also offer students, if they wish, the exciting opportunity of engaging with sustainability-based learning experiences outside of the university."],

Through considering topics such as Traditional Ecological Knowledge, patterns of land tenure and management, the power of anthropomorphism and the naturalising of social differences and inequalities, students will develop an understanding of recent approaches to a key issue in anthropology \u2013 the relationship between Nature and Culture. How we imagine that relationship is deeply implicated in some of the questions we are all now having to confront. Do we work with Nature, or against it? Did we invent \u2018Nature\u2019 (another of those pesky dualities)? And have we now brought about \u2018the end of nature\u2019?

Topics covered will include the factors that influence yield such as plant genetic make-up, plant functioning, climatic zones, crop management practices including nutrient management, crop rotations, crop protection, and will also focus on measurement of crop yield. Consideration of the impact of climatic uncertainties and management practices will provide students with a sound understanding of the requirements of a profitable and sustainable cropping system, and the competencies needed to manage such a system. This subject will be delivered as combination of lectures, workshops and hands-on field and laboratory activities at the Dookie campus, and will capitalise on the proximity of Dookie to major cropping enterprises of the north central and Goulburn Valley regions."],
